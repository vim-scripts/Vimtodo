These tests require the runVimTests and VimTap plugins to be installed. The
are available from:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2565 and
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2213

The tests should all run with the -0 (pure) and -1 (default) options.
Successful runs using the -2 (load user .vimrc/plugins) option is dependent
upon the settings the user has in their user files.

To run the tests, execute the runVimTests.sh command on the test directory.
For example:

    ~/.vim/bin/runVimTests.sh -0 .

You can also optinally specify a specific set of tests to run by replacing the
directory name with one of the test files:

    ~/.vim/bin/runVimTests.sh -0 test001.vim
